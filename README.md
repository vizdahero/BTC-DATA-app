# BTC-DATA-app
BTC DATA is an app in which all information about Bitcoin and the Lightning Network is collected - Allin1


This is an app about Bitcoin and Lightning Network with some features like QR Generator / Scanner, Mempool, Converter Tool and more




## Why did you do that?

I wanted a tool that would allow me to collect all information about Bitcoin in one app with a few additional functions





## How you did this?

I spend the last weeks alot with MIT appinventor.





## How does it work?

This app request permanently apiÂ´s to get this information what i need for this app.
(mempoolspace, ambossspace, 1ml, blockexplorer)





## What happens if an error occurs or is faulty?

I've been testing a lot the last few days, there is minimal chance of getting an error like list attempt failure or an API is offline.
If it happens, just close the app, wait a minute, and then open it again.
However, I found a little thing and I don't know why, if you change the screens frequently, you may get an error on the BTC DATA SCREEN
In this case, restart the app.
